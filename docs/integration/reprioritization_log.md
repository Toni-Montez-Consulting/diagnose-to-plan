# Reprioritization Log

Use this log after meaningful Practice OS changes so backlog movement is
deliberate and visible.

## 2026-05-02: Source Thesis/Spec/Schema Integrated

Source:

- `docs/source/practice_os_build_spec_v0_1.md`
- `docs/source/ai_implementation_layer_thesis_and_build_spec_v0_1.md`
- `database/schema/practice_os_schema_v0_1.sql`

Change:

- Preserved the new source material in canonical DTP paths.
- Added a source index, integration map, concept registry, and source-material
  ADR.
- Closed the missing-source-file conflict and opened narrower schema/app/portal
  integration conflicts for future resolution.

Priority impact:

1. Source preservation is complete for this slice.
2. Integration mapping is the current control layer.
3. Schema reconciliation against Hosted DTP Phase 0 is now Ready, not active.
4. Thought Inbox / Input Studio module templates are the next additive product
   slice.
5. Hosted app implementation remains gated and separate.

Next review trigger:

- Toni approves the next module-template slice.
- Hosted DTP schema/app implementation is explicitly reopened.
- A client cycle produces real inputs for Thought Inbox, Input Studio,
  Opportunity Scoring, Exception Register, Value Ledger, or Memory Review.

## 2026-05-02: Practice OS Build Appendage Added

Source: `AGENTS.md`

Change:

- Added additive Practice OS product guidance to the DTP root agent
  instructions.
- Preserved the existing repo boundary that `CLAUDE.md` remains required
  reading for DTP work.
- Recorded the current gap that the newly referenced source/spec/schema files
  are not present yet.

Priority impact:

- Keep DTP as the internal Practice OS source of truth.
- Treat the named source docs and schema as pending inputs until they are added
  or mapped.
- Continue implementing scoped additive slices from the current DTP
  architecture instead of restructuring around absent source files.

Next review trigger:

- A new source thesis/spec/schema file is added.
- Hosted DTP/schema work resumes.
- A future implementation prompt relies on the newly referenced source paths.
