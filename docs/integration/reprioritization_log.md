# Reprioritization Log

Use this log after meaningful Practice OS changes so backlog movement is
deliberate and visible.

## 2026-05-02: Practice OS Build Appendage Added

Source: `AGENTS.md`

Change:

- Added additive Practice OS product guidance to the DTP root agent
  instructions.
- Preserved the existing repo boundary that `CLAUDE.md` remains required
  reading for DTP work.
- Recorded the current gap that the newly referenced source/spec/schema files
  are not present yet.

Priority impact:

- Keep DTP as the internal Practice OS source of truth.
- Treat the named source docs and schema as pending inputs until they are added
  or mapped.
- Continue implementing scoped additive slices from the current DTP
  architecture instead of restructuring around absent source files.

Next review trigger:

- A new source thesis/spec/schema file is added.
- Hosted DTP/schema work resumes.
- A future implementation prompt relies on the newly referenced source paths.
